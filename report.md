## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

and load the data we already wrangled:

``` r
load("rda/murders.rda")
```
